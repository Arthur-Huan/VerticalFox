*The auto hide also works on Tree Style Tabs, but you may need to adjust the css to achieve the best look.*
## How to apply
1. You need to have [Sidebery](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/) installed.

2. If you haven't customized your Firefox before, check out [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/wiki/userchrome/) for how to set up your Firefox and the profiles.
   
3. Once you have your `chrome` folder under your profile directory, download the `userChrome.css` in [mac](./mac/) or [windows](./windows/) according to your OS, and copy it into `chrome`. Alternatively you can create a blank `userChrome.css` and paste the code.


4. Go to the settings of Sidebery, go to **Styles editor**, paste all the code in [sidebery-styles.css](./sidebery_styles.css).
